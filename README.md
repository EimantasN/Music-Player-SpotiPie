# Music Player SpotiPie

## Description

There are many music applications that provide a modern interface and unlimited music choices. But the problem is, that you can't listen to the music you have on your other devices. One of the solutions is to transfer all your music to your phone, but with high quality  expesialy *Flac* music, it won't work because it's rare for any mobile device to have so much free space. Big brands like Spotify and Deezer give you the ability to listen music using internet connection and save music in internal memory. But after importing your music to these app you will lose quality and of course you have to pay. In order to solve the problem I decided to create SpotiPie that would allow YOU to freely listen your own songs.
